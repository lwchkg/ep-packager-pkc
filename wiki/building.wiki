= How to build the application =

== Needed program/libraries ==
 # MinGW (Any GNU C++ should be okay, but this program is only tested under Windows XP)
 # MSYS (to compile PDFlib Lite 7)
 # Qt4 Open Source Edition [http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource]
 # QuaZIP [http://quazip.sourceforge.net/]
 # PDFlib Lite 7 [http://www.pdflib.com/download/free-software/pdflib-lite/]

== Build Procedures ==
 # Download and install MinGW
 # Download and compile Qt4. Commands:
  # `configure -release -static -no-exceptions -no-qt3support -plugin-sql-sqlite -plugin-sql-odbc -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg`
  # `mingw32-make release`
 # Download and compile QuaZIP. Put libquazip.a and all headers in the MinGW directory.
 # Download and compile PDFlib Lite 7 using MSYS.
  # The library is configured to produce static library only.
  # Change `#undef PDC_UNICODE_FILENAME` to `#define PDC_UNICODE_FILENAME` in libs/pdcore/pc_config.h _note: we absolutely need Unicode_
  # `make`
  # Add bind/pdflib/cpp/pdflib.lo to lib/pdflib/.libs/pdflib.a using the libtool given by PDFlib (note: I've forgotten the exact command line)
  # Put the final library and the C & C++ headers in MinGW directory. The library should be named libpdf.a
 # Compile this program
