E-Portfolio Packager is a small program for adding files to a empty ZIP archive by batch processing.

It's main use resides in the e-portfolio webpage in Pui Kiu College (located in Hong Kong). However, the source code might be useful for anyone who is interested to do ZIP/PDF processing using Qt 4.
